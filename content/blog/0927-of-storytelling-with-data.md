## We aren't naturally good at storytelling with data
It's rare that language and math are paired：no one teaches us how to tell stories with numbers.
Being able to visualize data and tell stories with it is key to turning it into information that can be used to drive better decision making.
There is a story in your data.But your tools don't know what that story is.That's where it takes you-the analyst or communicator of the information—to bring that story visually and contextually to life.
Being able to tell stories with data is a skill that’s becoming ever more important in our world of increasing data and desire for data driven decision making.
