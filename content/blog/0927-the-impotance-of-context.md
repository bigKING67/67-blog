# chapter 1- the importance of context
Before you begin down the path of creating a data visualization or communication, attention and time should be paid to understanding the context for the need to communicate.
In this chapter, we will focus on understanding the important components of context and discuss some strategies to help set you up for success when it comes to communicating visually with data.

## 1. Exploratory vs. explanatory analysis
**Important distinction between exploratory and exploratory analysis** 
* Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand the data and figure out what might be **_noteworthy or interesting to highlight_** to others.When we do exploratory analysis, it’s like hunting for pearls in oysters. We might have to open 100 oysters (test 100 different hypotheses or look at the data in 100 different ways) to find perhaps two pearls
* Too often, people err and think it’s OK to show exploratory analysis (simply present the data, all 100 oysters) when they should be showing explanatory (taking the time to turn the data into information that can be consumed by an audience: **_the two pearls_**)

## 2. Who, what, and how
 1. First, To whom are you communicating? It is important to have a good understanding of who your audience is and how they perceive you. This can help you to identify common ground that will help you ensure they hear your message. 
2. Second, What do you want your audience to know or do? You should be clear how you want your audience to act and take into account how you will communicate to them and the overall tone that you want to set for your communication.
3. It’s only after you can concisely answer these first two questions that you’re ready to move forward with the third: How can you use data to help make your point?
